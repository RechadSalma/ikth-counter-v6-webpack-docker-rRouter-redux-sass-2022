# ikth-counter-v6-webpack-docker-rRouter-redux-sass-2022

## Status

- 20220209: _completed just creating Dockerfile & deployed it on Heroku. It was a lot more complicated than I thought. I will do Dockerfile.dev & docker compose on the next repo. However it was successful & manage to deploy it on Heroku_
  - _I failed to deploy it just using docker image on my local computer at first. Nothing was working. I tried doing it with docker repository push & followed youtube/documentation & it finally worked_

---

## Mission

- Wanted to test out: Docker & its Dockerfile to work & be deployed on Heroku. So I clone version05 & just focus on Docker & Heroku
- Three route paths:
  - `/` = counter page with three working redux buttons
  - `/side` = whatever page
  - `/form` = contact form
  - `/*` = error page
- working counter with redux
- use of SASS within my webpack template

- javascript
- react
- react-router
- redux
  - @redux-devTools/extension
  - redux-thunk
